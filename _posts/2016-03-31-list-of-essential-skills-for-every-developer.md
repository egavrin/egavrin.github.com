Currently, there are many posts from engineers listing `essential`, `useful` or `must have` skills and certain posts have useful bits of information. So I decided to prepare my own list of `essential skills` that will be useful for any abstract developer including myself, but immediately faced an issue. Simple list of technical `nice-to-know` skills won't be useful for self-development purposes without proper categorization. Skills can be technical, professional, communication etc. Here we come to the fundamental issue in Russian educational system that is widely prevalent in Universities is knowledge based learning where the emphasis lies on fundamental facts. Education is highly theoretical and not much time is dedicated to practical skills.

```
